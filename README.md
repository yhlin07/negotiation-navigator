# Negotiation Navigator 🎯

**Cut through the chaos. Find the key points. Win the deal.**

## The Problem

MBA negotiation cases are deliberately complex. 20+ page briefs. Multiple issues. Hidden interests. Confusing numbers. By the time you find what matters, the negotiation is over.

## The Solution

- **Visual decision trees** — Know your moves before you walk in
- **Real-time calculators** — Instant score validation during negotiation
- **Clear target packages** — Know exactly what "good" looks like
- **Red lines highlighted** — Never cross your bottom line
